## Background

- Using [[biosensors]] to sense breathing has been the focus of many [[HCI]] projects and studies.
- Many researchers have worked with breathing in different ways, such as: translating breathing signals into light, sound, or haptics.
- There has been collaborations with dancers and choreographers to learn more about creative applications of biosensors.

## Research

#### Research question
- How to capture nuanced somatic experiences of breathing?

#### Sensing breathing
- Breathing is typically sensed by putting stretch [[sensors]] on the thorax and measuring the expansion and depression of the rib cage.
- Other non-habitual types of breathing have been sensed as well, this is done by getting experiment participants to play breathing "games". For example, a study asked participants to exhale through pursed lips, and measured the results with a microphone.

#### Somatic breathing
- Somatic breathing is basic conscious breathing, being aware of ones physical and mental self. 
- In attempts to better understand somatic breathing, three strategies were employed:
	1.  Working closely with a somatic connoisseur (a singer), to learn complex breathing exercises.
	2.  Practiced non-habitual breathing, and the exercises that were learned.
	3. Exploring sensing mechanisms, and trying to understand what the experience of being sensed is like.
