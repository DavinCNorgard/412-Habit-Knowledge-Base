A prototype designed to study non-habitual breathing.

## Design Process

- Over a period of time a team of designers/researchers practiced these exercises and recorded body maps, photos, videos, and written data. This helped drive the design of the new [[sensors]]. 
- Different sensor types were tested:
	1. Wearable strain sensor, this is a belt worn around the torso that measures the displacement of the fabric when breathing.
	2. EMG sensor, this is a three electrode sensor that is placed on the abdomen and measures muscle contractions.
	3. Shape-change sensor-actuator pillows, this was custom built with an Arduino controller to experiment with pillows that filled with air and applied pressure to the skin.

### 3 Main components

1. The leotard that contains embedded EMG sensors which measure breathing movements of the abdominal muscle.
2. Four shape-change sensor-actuator pillows
3. An external rigid [[wearable devices]] structure that keeps the pillows on the body
