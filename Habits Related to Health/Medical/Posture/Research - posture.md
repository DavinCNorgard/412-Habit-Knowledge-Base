Lots of research is being done of systems to assist people with improving peoples' posture habits. 

One main way they are doing this is through biofeedback through [[wearable devices]].


**Wearable Speaker**

Researchers are designing posture [[feedback]] system that gives a user audio feedback when the user's neck is in a bad posture while using a laptop and/or smartphone.

**Wearable Necklace Sensor** 

Researchers are designing posture feedback system using a smart necklace, notebook computer and smartphone. The computer/necklace assesses posture via the camera and position of necklace. [[alerts]] are sent to a [[smartphone app]].

**Wearable Belt** 

Researches have designed a belt-system that user's can wear that will provide feedback via vibration through the belt to correct posture.

**Wearable Vest**

Researchers are designing a vest to monitor posture habits in elderly patients. They are placing [[sensors]] in key positions on the vest, with the data being fed into a MatLab program that analyses the sensor data. While the research is primarily dedicated to the monitoring portion, the researchers state that ongoing work can be made to develop a [[smartphone app]] which can alert either a person's medical team and/or the wearer themselves.
