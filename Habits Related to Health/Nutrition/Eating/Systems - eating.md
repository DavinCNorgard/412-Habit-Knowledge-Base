The EcoMeal is a smart tray containing [[sensors]] that was created by researchers to support the user’s eating speed, food portion control and calorie/sodium management. This was done by making a tray that can track eating speed by comparing the difference of weight over time.

Pavloks are[[wearable devices]] designed to help with behavior modification, including promoting healthy eating habits. The Pavlok device uses conditioning to help remind the user to break bad habits and build healthy habits. Users can set up specific triggers related to their unhealthy behaviors, such as overeating or eating junk food. For example, they might set up the device to vibrate or deliver a mild electric shock when they want to go get a bag of chips. This small shock will make them remember that what they’re doing is bad and stop the subconscious behavior of grabbing the food. The Pavlok device uses the idea of behavior [[aware]]ness where when the user does an undesirable behavior, the device provides [[feedback]] (vibration or mild shock), creating an uncomfortable sensation or distraction. Then this sensation or distraction will be associated with the behavior and the user will be less likely to want to do it.
Users will be guided to get rid of their bad habits through the use of [[negative reinforcement]]. Over time, the discomfort associated with the unhealthy behavior can condition the individual to avoid it. This is a form of [[classical conditioning]]. To build healthy habits the user of the device can reward themselves after stopping a negative behavior. For example, instead of reaching for a bag of chips they can be notified and then eat something healthy such as carrots. Long time persistence of using the device will gradually remove the bad habits and create the new positive habits. Pavlok has been researched for many years and is often seen working with training animals such as dogs where the buzz can tell the dog that barking is bad and they won’t bark as much.

The sensor embedded fork is a fork created by researchers targeting children that get easily distracted while eating. The fork is paired with a game or book to make eating more fun and to provide more reasons to eat.
