**Disruptabottle: Encouraging Hydration With a Overﬂowing Bottle**

**Summary**

The disruptabottle was created to encourage healthy hydration and the research behind it was presented at the CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. The research was done by giving a participant a nudge or shove to aggressively change a participants behaviour. In this case it was done by pushing the participant to reach adequate levels of hydrations and threatening to spill water if the participant doesn't drink enough. There were 24 participants and their results were recorded in different methods resulting in 92% of the participants believing that the disruptabottle was an effective method to promote healthy hydrating.

**Related Works**

The Disruptabottle uses [[human centered programming]] and conducting [[usability testing]] to measure the effects of a special water bottle for building healthy hydration habits. This is similar to a lot of other technologies in this field as there have previously been many technologies that use nudge theory, punishment and [[negative reinforcement]] to promote healthy habits. One good example is having [[smartphone app]]s vibrate to tell you to stand up or take a break.

**How the prototype works**

The Disruptabottle went through three phases of prototypes to figure out the best method to effectively pump out water and give the user the best user experience. They finally decided to go along with a product that has a water pump that controls the amount of water being pumped out with tubing on the side of the bottle. One other feature that was important to the bottle is that the visibility of the water level is clear to the user thus making them drink more or less responding to it.

**Results**

The researchers had the participants drink out of the Disruptabottle and recorded the emotions of the participants and asked the participants a number of questions after they finished drinking. The emotions that were recorded were the 10 basic emotions based off of [[Robert Plutchik’s Psycho-evolutionary Theory of Basic Emotions]]. The Questionnaire’s questions were to survey the demand of the bottle and how useful it is as a product.

The researchers also found that this bottle was especially useful in a university setting where the users would need to be reminded to drink more water and build healthy hydration habits.
