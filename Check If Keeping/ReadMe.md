### Setup 

1. Download Obsidian 
2. Clone this git repo
3. Open the "412 project notes" file in obsidian
### Structure

- I have started using this format for the Mental Health section, so feel free to use this as an example

#### Habit page

- Add your subsections to this page
- link any research or notes and your overview

#### Sub-sections

- Everyone is in charge of their own sub-section (ie addiction, Nutrition, etc....)
- inside each sub-section, there will be an overview of how the notes, and ideas in your research relate to habits, cognitive augmentation, concepts, and other subsections

#### Terms 

- If you think a "term" will be used in more than one paper, you can add it to the terms section and link to it in your papers
- The terms notes will just be the definition

#### Concepts

- Similar to the terms section, but these can be larger more over-arching topics. 
- These could be theories, or just larger ideas, an example would be HCI (human computer interaction)
