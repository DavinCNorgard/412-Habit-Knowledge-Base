**EcoMeal: A Smart Tray for Promoting Healthy Dietary Habits**

**Summary**

The EcoMeal was created to promote healthy eating habits especially for patients who suffer from metabolic syndrome because healthy eating habits are more important for them. To solve this problem, the researchers from Japan and Taiwan created a prototype tray that uses [[persuasive computing]] to support the user’s eating speed, food portion control and calorie/sodium management. The healthy eating habits are created by making the food plating and eating process more enjoyable. Dietary habits are known to be one of the main contributing factors for obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. The study was conducted 3 couples and the results were quite controversial as the user feedback showed both positive and negative responses to the prototype.

**Related Works**

The HCI community have been making different prototypes to promote healthy eating habits for a while. This is done from ingredient purchase to food consumption using different approaches. One example is Foodle which used grocery purchase information to generate recommendation by comparing the nutritional information with the user’s dietary goal. There has also been camera and weight based research that uses camera's and weight sensors in the kitchen to determine the type of food and the weight to calculate the amount of calories.

**Prototype**

Based on user data, the researchers saw that their were a few needs for the tray to be successful:
- A personalized tray  
- Quantification of the initial serving portion  
- Real-time feedback on their eating pace 
- Daily calorie and sodium management 

A start button when the user starts their eating session. The weight of the initial food is compared to the weight of the food after the end of the session. Then the difference in weight of the food and the length of the eating session is used to calculate the speed of the user. The total calories is also displayed for the user. The tray is separated into four sections for different foods.

**Results**

The food was put into a Korean- like setting with the rice on the bottom left and a soup on the bottom right. Other dishes were put into the top two bowls. Once the session started the users found that they were eating much faster because the timer made it feel like they were in a rush to finish eating. The prototype seemed effective but there were also many external factors that could affect the eating speed of the user for example, one user stated that eating with his wife made him eat the same speed as her.


**Persuasive Technology to Improve Eating Behavior using a Sensor-Embedded Fork**

**Summary**

The sensor-embedded fork created by these researchers goal was to solve the problem of picky eaters or easily distracted eaters in children. Often times, children need some motivation to help them eat and in this case by having a sensor-embedded digital fork, the child can play games by eating to address these eating habits. This solution falls under [[persuasive computing]] and ubiquitous computing. The research was conducted on five mother-child pairs and through discussion it was concluded that the sensor fork and persuasive educational tools can be used to improve eating habits in children.

**Related Works**

There are many various projects related to diet in the HCI area. Some of these include a computing game that encourages children and young people to enjoy learning what food has good nutritional value and what food has bad nutritional value. There has also been trays that are made to entertain the children. An example of this is "The Playful Tray," which targets slow eating children and presents the food in a fun way to encourage quick eating.

**Prototype**

To create the final product of the sensor embedded fork a few prototypes were made first. These prototypes ended up adding to the finished product by figuring out what states the fork will have and what the fork will need to do. The final product ended up having eating detection and split it up into four states. These states being resting, holding, poking and biting. The fork was also made so that it could sensor what type of food that it is being used for. This was done with a sensor to read colour and  resistance value to classify the food. Other than the fork, the applications also needed to be well planned. The researches used a game and a book to promote the children to eat. They created "Hungry Panda," an eating game that imitates a panda eating. The story book would tell a story about the food and make the child more likely to want to eat it.

**Results**

From the 5 parents and children pairs, the researchers gathered results by having questionnaires and by comparing what would usually be left over without the use of the fork and what is left over after the use of the fork.

The feedback from the parents varied as some parents appreciated that the product would work for their child but sometimes parents wouldn't want to have their child reliant on the fork or spending too much time using a digital device. Another problem with just having the fork is that it is sometimes impractical when eating specific foods such as soup. Thus, other utensils should also be created.
