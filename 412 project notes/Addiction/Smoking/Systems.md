### [[Wearable Devices]]
While still not an official product, researchers at Case Western Reserve University have developed a smartphone app designed to help smokers quit by detecting specific smoking motions through two armband sensors. The sensors have an accuracy rate of over 98% in distinguishing smoking motions from other similar movements. Early findings show its effectiveness in tracking smoking activity is more accurate than self-reporting methods.

Other attempts at smoking event detection devices were made using various sensors, including radio frequency sensors on the wrist and a receiver on the chest to detect the distance between them. As well as a systems to captured lung volume changes using abdominal sensor bands. A device was also used to analyse the sensor signals and detect smoking actions. While this system is a bit clunky, with some work it could be reduce down to a system more resembling the first device mentioned.![[Wearable smoking device.jpg]]
### Juul
JUUL is an electronic cigarette, that was initially marketed as a smoking cessation aid to help smokers quit traditional tobacco cigarettes. It is designed to work as an alternative to smoking by providing a similar motions, a nicotine hit, and the sensation of inhaling and exhaling vapor. While it can help break the habit of smoking, it usually does this by replacing the habits with another one which more often than not doesn't solve the problem.

### QuitBit
The QuitBit is a digital smart lighter that aims to help individuals break smoking habits by providing real-time data and insights into their smoking behaviour. It includes an app that can also boost the users motivation by providing feedback and rewards once the user has achieved certain milestones.
