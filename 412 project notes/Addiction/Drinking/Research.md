- Virtual reality (VR) is increasingly used to assess cravings and related responses in SUD (Substance use disorders).
- Studies use VR for craving induction/assessment and therapy across different substances.
- Consistent results in reducing cravings, despite limitations.
- VR is a promising tool for assessing and treating craving in SUD.
- Combines lab setting benefits with realistic environments.

- Biosensors are crucial for observing physiological events, offering non-invasive detection and understanding of various health conditions.
- Wearable biosensors are increasingly used in mental and physical health research, including substance use studies.
- Biosensors used to determine alcohol use disorders and their potential for treatment recommendations.
- Wearable biosensors are used to identify alcohol intoxication
- Continuous passive monitoring compared to traditional methods.
- Biosensors are used for intoxication monitoring through smart sensors on wrist, shoe, or smartphones
- Initially designed for court-ordered sobriety, these devices are now used in clinical trials for behavioural treatments. 
- Also explored for physical activity tracking and guiding interventions for relapse prevention.
- Wearable biosensors reduce alcohol consumption and aid behavioural treatments.
