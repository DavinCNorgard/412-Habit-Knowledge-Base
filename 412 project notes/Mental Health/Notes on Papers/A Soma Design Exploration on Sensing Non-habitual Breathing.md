## Summary

- Breathing is a complex bodily function.
- Designing for breathing as a non-habitual act in different contexts.
- Conducted a design exploration with a classical singer.
- Developed a new sensing mechanism using shape-change technologies integrated into a wearable called the Breathing Shell.
- Focus on creating a reciprocal experience of "feeling the sensor feeling you" during breathing.
- Two design implications:
    1. Reflecting on the somatic impact of being sensed along with the type of data collected.
    2. Creating a tactile impact of the sensor data on the body.
- Aims to deepen understanding of how the entire body relates to biosensors and promotes designing symbiotic experiences between biosensors and bodies.

## Background

- Using biosensors to sense breathing has been the focus of many [[HCI]] projects and studies.
- Many researchers have worked with breathing in different ways, such as: translating breathing signals into light, sound, or haptics.
- There has been collaborations with dancers and choreographers to learn more about creative applications of biosensors.

## Research

#### Research question
- How to capture nuanced somatic experiences of breathing?

#### Sensing breathing
- Breathing is typically sensed by putting stretch sensors on the thorax and measuring the expansion and depression of the rib cage.
- Other non-habitual types of breathing have been sensed as well, this is done by getting experiment participants to play breathing "games". For example, a study asked participants to exhale through pursed lips, and measured the results with a microphone.

#### Somatic breathing
- Somatic breathing is basic conscious breathing, being aware of ones physical and mental self. 
- In attempts to better understand somatic breathing, three strategies were employed:
	1.  Working closely with a somatic connoisseur (a singer), to learn complex breathing exercises.
	2.  Practiced non-habitual breathing, and the exercises that were learned.
	3. Exploring sensing mechanisms, and trying to understand what the experience of being sensed is like.


## Design Process

- Over a period of time a team of designers/researchers practiced these exercises and recorded body maps, photos, videos, and written data. This helped drive the design of the new sensors. 
- Different sensor types were tested:
	1. Wearable strain sensor, this is a belt worn around the torso that measures the displacement of the fabric when breathing.
	2. EMG sensor, this is a three electrode sensor that is placed on the abdomen and measures muscle contractions.
	3. Shape-change sensor-actuator pillows, this was custom built with an Arduino controller to experiment with pillows that filled with air and applied pressure to the skin.
