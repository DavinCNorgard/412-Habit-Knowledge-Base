Astrojumper: Motivating Exercise with an Immersive Virtual Reality Exergame.

**Summary**

Researchers developed Astrojumper a virtual reality exercise game (exergame) designed for full-body exercise (Finkelstein et al., 2011). The research had 30 participants aged 6-50 play exergames for 15 minutes. The results showed an increase in heart rate among all participants as well as a positive experience. In addition, there was a positive correlation between perceived workout intensity and [[motivation]] which shows promise for physical exercise habit formation and retention.

**Related Work**

Exergaming has increased in popularity in recent years. Some exergames include Kick Ass Kung-Fu, Cateye GameBike, and Xbox Kinect. One of the issues with these games is an effective balance of engagement and physical exertion. When users tried Kick Ass Kung-Fu they found it was effective in increasing [[motivation]] but had limited system intractability. Other games, such as Sony EyeToy, were effective in being engaging but failed to sustain heart rates with long durations between exercises. There has been a large increase in obesity and video game usage among children, making exergames a possible opportunity to provide physical exercise in video games.

**Research question**

The researchers look at the efficacy of the video game Astrojumer in motivating people to exercise.

**Design Process**

**Technology**

Astrojumper is a virtual reality exercise game that utilizes upper body motion tracking alongside a stereoscopic display. Astrojumper was played on a 3-sided projection display of size 8’x6’. The projectors used were Barco Gemini stereoscopic projectors and the user wore polarized glasses. Trackers are placed in the glasses, wrists, and waist. The game was developed using the osgVirtualEnvironment engine, 3D Studio Max, OpenAL, and virtual reality peripheral network.

**Game Design**

The game has the user fly through outer space in a stereoscopic environment. The objective is to dodge incoming planets through swerving, ducking, and jumping. For every second, a point is awarded to the user. Additional points can be achieved by tapping gold suns, these suns will give the user a point multiplier which will be added to the points earned per second. If a user is hit by a planet, the score remains the same for 2 seconds. If there are multiple collisions, freeze time will add up to a limit of 15 seconds. UFOs also appear throughout the game and require the user to dodge the incoming lasers and fight back by shooting lasers with a throwing motion. Music is played throughout the game to increase enjoyment. 

One key factor looked at during the design of Astrojumer was replayability as exercise is recommended multiple times per week. The game includes a diverse range of movements to allow the body to move in multiple ways. The game followed a 15% warm-up phase, a 70% activity phase and a final 15% cooldown phase. In the warm-up and cool-down phases, the objects moved at a slow pace allowing the body to maintain a lower heart rate. The total time of the game session was 15 minutes. Astrojumpers difficulty is dynamically adjusted based on the user's ability and fitness level. This was done to engage the user effectively. 

**Exercise Habits**

The participants consisted of 7 people who did not game, 15 casual, 5 intermediate, and 3 hardcore gamers. Exercise among the participants ranged widely but overall showed moderate exercise engagement. Motives for exercising were rated from 1-5, with 5 being fitness, then appearance, competence, and finally social motivations. The study looked at the correlation between [[motivation]], workout intensity, and video game enjoyment. No significant statistical relationship was found between these factors and the exercise motivation for AstroJumper. The results indicate that exergames have the potential to increase [[motivation]] for activity and thereby physical exercise habits regardless of video games and exercise habits.

**Future Work**

Future work could look at using less expensive and immersive equipment to provide more accessibility for exergames to the wider audience. A proposed system would be the Wii Fit or Xbox Kinect.
