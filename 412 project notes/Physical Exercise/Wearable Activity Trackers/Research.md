Effectiveness of wearable activity trackers to increase physical activity and improve health: a systematic review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses

**Summary**

Wearable activity trackers ([[wearable devices]]) have been found to increase habit formation and retention. For instance, wearable activity trackers promote building habits through [[Goal Setting]] and self-monitoring. Research has shown that wearable activity trackers promote physical activity and subsequently increase improved health metrics including BMI, reduction in blood pressure, and an increase in aerobic capacity.

**Research**

**Research question**

The researchers reviewed the literature and performed a meta-analysis to look at how wearable activity trackers can increase physical activity. 

**Design Process**
**Technology**

Wearable activity trackers are equipped with sensors that can monitor various metrics such as heart rate, cadence, GPS location, elevation, and time. Depending on the make and model, these trackers can be available at a cost-effective price range of $30-50 or can go up to over $1000 for the more advanced and precise models. They also can be quite visually appealing, usually with a watch-like appearance and are user-friendly. Some well-known companies that manufacture wearable activity trackers include Fitbit, Apple, Samsung, Garmin Watches, and Coros.
 
Wearable activity trackers have become increasingly popular with a 1444% increase from 2014-2020 (Ferguson et al., 2022). They have been shown to increase long-term exercise habit formation in older adults (Peng et al., 2021). In addition, they can help form exercise habits through daily reminders and encouragement for physical activity. Furthermore, they can provide users with physical activity metrics that can help them gamify or simply monitor their physical activity progression.

**Study Design**

The researchers reviewed 39 systemic reviews of experimental studies on wearable activity trackers. They looked at a wide range of metrics in physical activity, physiology and psychosocial. 

**Exercise Habits**

The results showed that many of the meta-analyses showed that wearable trackers had positive impacts on physical exercise over a wide range of metrics. Some of the strong positive metrics found include steps, physical activity, body composition, blood pressure, and fitness. Users achieved an average of 1800 additional steps, 40 more minutes of walking per day, and a 6-minute daily increase in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). The benefits were maintained over a period of at least six months. Although wearable trackers were associated with moderate weight loss and reduced waist circumference, the impact on other physiological measures, such as blood pressure, and cholesterol showed only small and sometimes non-significant effect sizes. Psychosocial outcomes, including quality of life, also showed only small improvements. The evidence from this study is clear that utilizing wearable activity monitors has a positive influence on exercise habit retention and improvement.
