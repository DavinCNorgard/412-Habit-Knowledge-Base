Habits are repeated behaviors that require little or no thought. They can be learned, or innate. They are a core aspect of cognition, as it allows humans to perform specific actions or tasks without needing to spend a lot of mental energy, even if the tasks are very complex in nature. 
These cognitive processes are reinforced through learning and repetition.

The flip side to this mental energy saving technique, is that many of our thoughts and behavior processes are done automatically, and can be difficult to change even when we want them to. Some can even be so ingrained, that we aren't even aware of having a particular habit until it is brought to our attention,

Our vault will focus on computing systems dealing with health related habits. Health is a wide and far reaching topic, and we definitely do not have an exhaustive list of all health categories. However, we have categorized our sub topics as follows: 

Addiction
	Drinking
	Gambling
	Smoking
	
Medical
	Dental Care
	Drug Adherence
	Posture

Mental Health
	Breathing
	Visual
	
Nutrition
	Eating
	Hydration

Physical Exercise
	Exercise Apps
	Virtual Reality
	Wearable Activity Trackers




In each final sub-section, we have included two notes: 
	One that looks into the research of computing systems centered around this topic
	One that looks into already existing systems centered around this topic
