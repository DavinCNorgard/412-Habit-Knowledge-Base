Habits are repeated behaviors that require little or no thought. They can be learned, or innate. They are a core aspect of cognition, as it allows humans to perform specific actions or tasks without needing to spend a lot of mental energy, even if the tasks are very complex in nature. 
These cognitive processes are reinforced through learning and repetition.

The flip side to this mental energy saving technique, is that many of our thoughts and behavior processes are done automatically, and can be difficult to change even when we want them to. Some can even be so ingrained, that we aren't even aware of having a particular habit until it is brought to our attention,

Our vault will focus on computing systems dealing with health related habits. Health is a wide and far reaching topic, and we definitely do not have an exhaustive list of all health categories. However, we have categorized our sub topics as follows: 

Addiction
	Drinking
 		[[Drinking Systems]] and [[Drinking Research]]
	Gambling
 		[[Gambling Systems]] and [[Gambling Research]]
	Smoking
 		[[Smoking Systems]] and [[Smoking Research]]
	
Medical
	Dental Care
 		[[Dental Care Systems]] and [[Dental Care Research]]
	Drug Adherence
 		[[Drug Systems]] and [[Drug Research]]
	Posture
 		[[Posture Systems]] and [[Posture Research]]

Mental Health
	Breathing
 		[[Breathing Systems]] and [[Breathing Research]]
	Visual
 		[[Visual Systems]] and [[Visual Research]]
	
Nutrition
	Eating
 		[[Eating Systems]] and [[Eating Research]]
	Hydration
 		[[Hydration Systems]] and [[Hydration Research]]

Physical Exercise
	Exercise Apps
 		[[Exercise Apps Systems]] and [[Exercise Apps Research]]
	Virtual Reality
 		[[Virtual Reality Systems]] and [[Virtual Reality Research]]
	Wearable Activity Trackers
 		[[Wearable Activity Trackers Systems]] and [[Wearable Activity Trackers Research]]




In each final sub-section, we have included two notes: 
	One that looks into the research of computing systems centered around this topic
	One that looks into already existing systems centered around this topic
