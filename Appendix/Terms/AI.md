The main system used to combat gambling habits has been the use of AI to analyse and predict player habits and detect when a problem is forming. Once a problem is detected the AI would warn the user/player before the problem grows.

- Online gambling offers real-time behaviour monitoring and personalized interactions.
- Most online gambling industries provide their APIs to enhance user experience.
- Suggests using APIs to access gamblers' online data for responsible gambling systems.
- AI algorithms require training data.
- The study analysed data from 1,287 real-world online casino players.
- Random forest and gradient boost machine algorithms predict self-reported problem gambling.
- Problem gamblers exhibit distinct behavioural patterns, including higher losses and more frequent deposits.
- High accuracy in predicting self-reported problem gambling with AI algorithms.
